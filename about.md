I'm Alex. I've started writing this blog for myself. I want to document my work with CT algorithms in an unbias way. I've worked with CT reconstruction and VMAT CT for a few years but frankly, my memories are not always fond ones. I, like many people committed to their work, often only remember my failures without remembering the successes. This was made by [@alexuk86](https://twitter.com/alexuk86).


## About Me
Professionally I'm a Theraputic Radiographer. I live and work in Kent, UK but I'm originally ~~a wildling~~ a Northerner. I'm also gay and I love cats (not relevant). You might wonder about why a Theraputic Radiographer is so interested in CT and CT reconstruction ... it's part of the job. Radiotherapy is more than just treating the patients, we take images for nearly every fraction of treatment, including many many cone beam CTs. Mostly these are to assess a patient's position. Over time this is something I've developed a passion for, both for dose reduction and for improving image quality.

### Education
I went to school. Picked up some GCSE's (2002) and A-Levels (2004), they're mostly irrelevant now. I've also picked up some University education:
- University of Liverpool. Radiotherapy and Oncology BSc (Hons) (2007)
- Sheffield Hallam University. Advanced Practice (Radiotherapy) MSc (2016)

### Projects
Through my Masters I've picked up a couple CT and CT-based projects:
- Intra-fraction motion analysis of fiducial markers using stereoscopic VMAT imaging
- Developing an iterative VMAT-CT algorithm and comparing it to filtered back-projection VMAT-CT

Just through general interest I've started:
- FBP CBCT using openCL and Python (for speed and flexibility)
- Iterative CBCT - also using openCL and Python (to improve image quality)
- Methods to deal with missing data (to build on the VMAT-CT work and also metal artifact reduction)
