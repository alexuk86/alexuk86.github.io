title: An Introduction to CT

If you want to see inside something, an object, a person, a pet ... there are a few ways you can do that. I'm personally a huge fan of taking things apart to find out how they were put together - but it's not entirely the best approach to finding out what's inside your cat. Maybe you'd want something a little less destructive. If you have an X-ray machine you can shoot some X-rays through your cat and see how many come out the other end. That's great for 2D images but cats are notoriously three dimensional so your X-ray will actually be all your cat's 3D bits stacked on top of each other to the point where it takes some real skill to interpret. That's why Radiographers and Radiologists get paid the *big* bucks, right? <!--more-->

So ... you want a 3D image of the inside of your 3D thing. Reasonable ... I guess. Most people would use ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or X-ray computed tomography:
+ Ultrasound is where you send high frequency sound waves into your subject and listen to the response. Listen for how long it takes to come back and for changes in the returned sounds. You can build a 3D image with this but the quality will never be great.
+ Magnetic resonance imaging is a kind of witchcraft with insanely powerful magnets. Literally strong enough to turn all your hydrogen atoms to point in one axis. That's the thing though, it only works where you have a lot of hydrogen. It might be the universe's most common element but it's also a surprising limitation if you're wanting to work with anything that's very dead. Also, metals interact in unpleasant ways in big magnets.
+ So ... Computed Tomography

## Computed Tomography

Back to the cat. If you took your X-ray through your cat you'd know how radio-opaque it is at that angle. By taking X-ray images from all around the cat you'd have way more information to work with. This is how a CT is taken.

For reference, when you look at the cross sectional images of a CT scan they are axial images. This is where the name Computed Axial Tomography comes from... I like that term because it spells CAT.

There are some interesting bit about taking the images, but generally the magic is in the way you take all those 2D image from around the subject and make them into a crisp 3D image of the inside bits. This process is called "reconstruction".

## CT Reconstruction

As the phrase goes, there is more than one way to skin a CAT scan.
