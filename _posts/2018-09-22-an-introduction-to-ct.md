title: An Introduction to CT
---

If you want to see inside something, an object, a person, a pet ... there are a few ways you can do that. I'm personally a huge fan of taking things apart to find out how they were put together - but it's not entirely the best approach to finding out what's inside your cat. Maybe you'd want something a little less destructive. If you have an X-ray machine you can shoot some X-rays through your cat and see how many come out the other end. That's great for 2D images but cats are notoriously three dimensional so your X-ray will actually be all your cat's 3D bits stacked on top of eachother to the point where it takes some real skill to interpret. That's why Radiographers and Radiologists get paid the *big* bucks, right? <!---more--->
